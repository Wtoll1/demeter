Demeter is a Fabric Minecraft API by Wtoll that allows for the easy creation of crop properties similar to the old AgriCraft mod.

Demeter runs on [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) and only [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric). There will be no ports to other modding frameworks.

It should be noted that out of the box Demeter only modifies vanilla minecraft crops. This is because end users must opt-in to having Demeter work for certain modded crops because of the different ways that crops can be implemented. You're probably sitting there really bummed because that sounds like a lot of work, but the official Demeter Extra Crops datapack is available [here](https://github.com/Wtoll/Demeter-Extra-Crops) and contains compatibility with the vast majority of fabric's modded crops.
